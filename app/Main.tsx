        <p className="text-md text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
        A growing number of people are questioning national and international drug policies that prioritize strict law enforcement and punishment in an attempt to end the manufacture, trade, use, and cultivation of banned substancesâ€”a strategy known as the "war on drugs." The Global Drug Policy Observatory aims to advance evidence-based and human rights-based drug policies through thorough reporting, monitoring, and analysis of policy developments at both national and international levels. The project provides a platform for engaging with diverse audiences, including the press, opinion leaders, scholars, and members of law enforcement and policymaking sectors, to deepen and broaden the current policy discourse. The Observatory conducts a range of research activities, exploring not only the dynamics and implications of existing and emerging policy issues but also the processes behind policy shifts at various levels of governance.
